Mac Setup Checklist

This is your master blueprint for setting up a new Mac for development. It provides a clear, repeatable process for installing and configuring all the essential tools, from the command line foundation to your preferred code editors and programming languages.

Phase 1: The Foundation

[ ] Install Xcode Command Line Tools

Open the default Terminal app (you can find it in /Applications/Utilities/).

Run the command: xcode-select --install

Click Install in the pop-up window and agree to the terms.

[ ] Install Homebrew (The macOS Package Manager)

After Xcode tools are installed, run this command in your Terminal:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh))"


CRITICAL: After the installation finishes, the script will show you "Next steps". You must run the two commands it provides to add Homebrew to your PATH. They will look like this:

(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.zprofile


eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"


After running the commands, close and restart your Terminal.

[ ] Install and Switch to iTerm2 (Your Power Tool)

Install iTerm2 using Homebrew: brew install --cask iterm2

Close the old Terminal app. From now on, you will use iTerm2 for all command line work.

Phase 2: Version Control & Code Editors

[ ] Install Git & GitHub Desktop

[ ] Update Git using Homebrew: brew install git

[ ] Install the GitHub Desktop application: brew install --cask github

[ ] Install Sublime Text & Sublime Merge

[ ] Install the Sublime Text editor: brew install --cask sublime-text

[ ] Install the Sublime Merge Git client: brew install --cask sublime-merge

Phase 3: Programming Languages

[ ] Install Python

Install the latest version of Python 3: brew install python3

[ ] Install R & RStudio

[ ] Install the R language: brew install --cask r

[ ] Install the RStudio IDE: brew install --cask rstudio

Phase 4: Database Tools

[ ] Install a SQL Client

Install the TablePlus database client (the user interface): brew install --cask tableplus

[ ] Install a SQL Server

Install the MySQL database server (the engine that stores the data): brew install mysql

Phase 5: Understand Your Workflow

This is the process of how all the tools fit together for a typical project.

Pull: Use GitHub Desktop or the command line in iTerm2 (git pull) to get the latest version of your project.

Edit: Open the project folder in Sublime Text to write and edit your code (Python, SQL, R, etc.).

Commit: Use Sublime Merge or GitHub Desktop to visually review your changes, write a commit message, and save a snapshot of your work.

Push: Use the "Push" button or command (git push) to upload your changes to your public GitHub repository.

Query: Use TablePlus to connect to databases (like your local MySQL server), run SQL queries, and export results for analysis.
