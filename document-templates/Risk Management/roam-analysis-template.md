## ROAM Key

* **R - Resolved:** The risk/issue has been eliminated and is no longer a concern.
* **O - Owned:** The risk/issue has been assigned to a specific team member who will actively manage it through to resolution or mitigation.
* **A - Accepted:** The risk/issue is minor, cannot be reasonably resolved, or the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact. The team consciously chooses to accept it and work around it if necessary.
* **M - Mitigated:** The team has taken specific actions to reduce the probability or impact of the risk (or reduce the impact of an issue that has already occurred).
