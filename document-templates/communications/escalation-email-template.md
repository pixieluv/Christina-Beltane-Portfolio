**Dear [Recipient Name(s)],**

This email serves as a formal escalation regarding a critical issue/risk impacting the **[Project Name]** project.

**1. Summary of the Issue/Risk:**
_[Briefly and clearly describe the problem. What is happening? What is the potential or actual impact?]_
* Example: "We have identified a critical bug in the [System Name] integration that is currently blocking User Acceptance Testing (UAT) scheduled to start next week."
* Example: "Vendor X has informed us of a potential 4-week delay in delivering [Critical Component], which puts our planned launch date of [Date] at significant risk."

**2. Impact Assessment:**
_[Quantify the impact if possible. Focus on schedule, budget, scope, quality, or business goals.]_
* Example: "This testing blockage creates a minimum 1-week delay in the project schedule for every day it remains unresolved."
* Example: "This delay jeopardizes our ability to meet the market window for the holiday season, potentially impacting Q4 revenue targets."

**3. Actions Taken So Far:**
_[Briefly list the steps already taken by the project team to address the issue.]_
* Example: "The engineering team has spent 3 days attempting to debug the integration issue but has not yet identified the root cause."
* Example: "We have held two meetings with Vendor X to explore mitigation options, but no viable solution has been identified yet."

**4. Proposed Solution / Recommendation (If Applicable):**
_[If you have a recommended path forward, state it clearly.]_
* Example: "We recommend allocating additional senior engineering resources from Team Y for the next 48 hours to assist with debugging."
* Example: "We recommend initiating discussions with our backup vendor, Vendor Z, to assess their immediate availability."

**5. Specific Ask / Decision Needed:**
_[Clearly state what you need from the recipient(s).]_
* Example: "We request your approval to temporarily reassign 2 senior engineers from Team Y to this project."
* Example: "We need an urgent decision on whether to proceed with Vendor Z, accepting the potential cost increase, or to accept the 4-week schedule delay."

Please let me know your availability to discuss this further. We need to make a decision by [Date/Time] to mitigate further impact.

Thank you for your support.
