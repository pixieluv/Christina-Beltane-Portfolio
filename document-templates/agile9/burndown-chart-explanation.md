## 1. What is a Burndown Chart?

A Burndown Chart is a visual representation of work remaining versus time. It is commonly used in Agile methodologies (like Scrum) to track progress within a specific timebox (like a Sprint or a Release).

* **X-axis:** Represents Time (e.g., Days of a Sprint, Weeks of a Release).
* **Y-axis:** Represents Work Remaining (e.g., Story Points, Task Hours, Number of Tasks).

The chart typically shows two lines:
1.  **Ideal Burndown Line:** A straight diagonal line showing the rate at which work *should* be completed to finish on time.
2.  **Actual Burndown Line:** A line tracking the *actual* amount of work remaining each day/week.

**Purpose:** The chart provides a quick, visual indicator of whether the project/sprint is on track, ahead of schedule, or falling behind. If the actual line is consistently above the ideal line, it signals potential problems.

## 2. Data Structure Example (Markdown Table)**

_While the chart itself is graphical, the underlying data can be represented in a table. This example tracks remaining effort in hours over an 8-week period._

| Week           | Start | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 | Week 7 | Week 8 |
| :------------- | ----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| **Planned Hours** | N/A   | 30     | 30     | 30     | 30     | 30     | 30     | 30     | 30     |
| **Actual Hours** | N/A   | 45     | 33     | 11     | 16     | 20     | 40     | 26     | 23     |
| **Remaining Effort** | **240** | **195** | **162** | **151** | **135** | **115** | **75** | **49** | **26** |
| **Ideal Burndown** | **240** | **210** | **180** | **150** | **120** | **90** | **60** | **30** | **0** |
