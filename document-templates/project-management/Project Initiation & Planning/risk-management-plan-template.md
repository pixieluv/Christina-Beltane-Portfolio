### **A. Probability Chart**

| Probability | Qualitative Description       | Quantitative (If Measurable) |
| :---------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| High (H)    | High chance of occurring      | >50% chance                  |
| Medium (M)  | Medium chance of occurring    | 10% - 49% chance             |
| Low (L)     | Very low chance of occurring | <10% chance                  |

### **B. Impact Chart**

| Types of Impact | Low (L)                                   | Medium (M)                                        | High (H)                                              |

| Financial       | [e.g., < $10k cost increase]              | [e.g., $10k - $50k cost increase]                 | [e.g., > $50k cost increase or major revenue loss]   |
| Schedule        | [e.g., < 1 week delay]                    | [e.g., 1-4 week delay]                            | [e.g., > 1 month delay or missed critical deadline] |
| Scope/Quality   | [e.g., Minor feature impact]              | [e.g., Significant feature reduction/rework]    | [e.g., Project failure; inability to meet core goal] |
| People/Resource | [e.g., Minor impact on team morale/load] | [e.g., Significant overtime; potential burnout] | [e.g., High attrition; inability to resource project] |

### **C. Probability & Impact Matrix**

_This matrix determines the Overall Risk Level based on Probability and Impact._
