<summary><strong>Phase 1: Project Initiation</strong></summary>

_Initiation is crucial for asking the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting key project components._

**Guiding Questions (The 5 W's):**
* **What** will be done? (Steps, activities)
* **Why** is this project being undertaken? (Problem, benefit)
* **Who** will benefit? (Customers, stakeholders, employees)
* **When** does it need to be completed? (Deadline, timeframe)
* **Where** will the work be done? (Location, scope)

**Tips:**
* **Gather Multiple Perspectives:** Ask at least three stakeholders from different areas to describe the project. Synthesize their answers into a unified summary.
* **Define Clear Goals:** Use the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) to ensure goals are actionable. Ask stakeholders: "What does success look like?"
* **Create a Project Charter:** This living document is the central source of truth. Include summary, goals, deliverables, scope (in/out), benefits/costs. Get stakeholder sign-off.
* **Understand Stakeholders:** Identify everyone with a vested interest. Ask them:
    * What are your priorities and how does this project align?
    * What role do you want to play?
    * Who else should I talk to?
    * How do you prefer to be kept informed?
* **Leverage Org Charts:** Understand reporting structures and titles. Connect with administrative partners for insights on engaging senior leaders.

<summary><strong>Phase 2: Project Planning</strong></summary>

_Planning involves determining processes, workflows, and organizing resources to meet project goals._

**Guiding Questions (Team & Stakeholders):**
* **Get to Know Your Team:**
    * Have you worked on similar projects? What was your role?
    * What role do you expect here (contributor, reviewer, delegator)?
    * What are your personal goals for this project (skills, career path)?
    * How can I best support you as the PM?
* **Identify Milestones & Tasks:**
    * What are the major phases or deliverables (Milestones)?
    * What specific steps (Tasks) are needed to achieve each milestone?
    * How long will each task *realistically* take? (Challenge assumptions!)
* **Estimate Time & Effort (Challenge Experts):**
    * Break down large tasks: What are the smaller steps involved? How long for each?
    * Question assumptions: What resources (people, tools, materials) are assumed? How skilled are the people assumed to be? What if assumptions fail? Are there prerequisite tasks?
    * Compare to similar past projects: How long did those take? How is this project similar/different? Does that change your estimate?
* **Develop Key Documents:**
    * **Project Plan:** Scope, tasks, milestones, schedule, budget, comms plan, risk plan, SoW.
    * **Risk Management Plan:** Identify potential problems, assess impact/probability, plan mitigation.
    * **Communication Plan:** Who needs what information, when, and how?

**Tips:**
* **Build Relationships:** Connect with team members personally; strong relationships are an asset.
* **Use a WBS:** Break down large milestones into manageable tasks.
* **Document Everything:** Project plans provide visibility and streamline communication.

<summary><strong>Phase 3: Project Execution</strong></summary>

_Execution is where plans are put into action. Communication and quality management are key._

**Guiding Questions & Tips:**
* **Communication:**
    * Ask stakeholders their preferred communication methods (Email, Meeting, Chat, Reports).
    * Communicate consistently and coherently. Ensure everyone knows the status, focus, and next steps.
* **Maintaining Quality:**
    * Define quality standards based on project documents (Charter, Business Case) and stakeholder conversations.
    * Understand industry standards or legal requirements if applicable.
    * Implement quality management processes (e.g., quality checks, QA testing, feedback loops).
* **Tracking Progress:**
    * Use project tracking tools (Jira, Asana, Smartsheet) to monitor tasks, timelines, and budgets.
    * Hold regular status meetings (e.g., Daily Standups) to surface blockers.
    * Generate regular Status Reports for stakeholders.
* **Managing Risks & Issues:**
    * Use the Risk Management Plan and tools like ROAM analysis during team syncs.
    * Escalate critical issues promptly using a defined Escalation Path.
* **Managing Change:**
    * Have a clear process for evaluating and approving Change Requests.
    * Assess the impact of changes on scope, schedule, and budget. Communicate changes clearly.
* **Agile Approaches (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Consider Agile/Scrum for flexibility, faster feedback, and efficiency.
    * Key elements: Product Backlog, Sprints, Daily Scrums, Retrospectives.

<summary><strong>Phase 4: Project Closing</strong></summary>

_Closing ensures all work is done, processes are completed, and stakeholders formally recognize completion._

**Guiding Questions & Tips:**
* **Ensure Completion:** Has all defined scope been delivered? Are all tasks marked complete?

    * **Impact Report:** For senior stakeholders, demonstrates project value (Exec Summary, Results, What Worked, Next Steps).
    * **Closeout Report:** For PMs/Team, documents the project journey (Summary, Methodology, Results vs. Plan, Lessons Learned, Open Items, Project Archive Links).
* **Celebrate Success:**
    * Publicize the outcome within the organization.
