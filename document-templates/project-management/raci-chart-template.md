## RACI Key

* **R = Responsible:** Those who do the work to complete the task.
* **A = Accountable:** The *one* ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion.
* **C = Consulted:** Those whose opinions are sought, and with whom there is two-way communication.
* **I = Informed:** Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion, and with whom there is just one-way communication.
