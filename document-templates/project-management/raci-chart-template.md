## RACI Key

* **R = Responsible:** Those who do the work to complete the task.
* **A = Accountable:** The *one* ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion.
* **C = Consulted:** Those whose opinions are sought, and with whom there is two-way communication.
* **I = Informed:** Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion, and with whom there is just one-way communication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure only **one 'A' (Accountable)** is assigned per task row

> [!NOTE] 
* **Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest):** [e.g., Frequent 1:1s, involve in key decisions, detailed status reports]
* **Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest):** [e.g., Regular high-level updates, consult on major changes, ensure needs are met]
* **Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest):** [e.g., Group updates, newsletters, access to documentation, solicit feedback]
* **Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest):** [e.g., General communications, minimal effort unless status changes]
