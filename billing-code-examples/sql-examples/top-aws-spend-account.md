## **Top 5 AWS Spend by Account**
---

### **The Business Problem**

After identifying the top spending products, the next logical question is, "Which teams or business units are driving that spend?" This query helps answer that by identifying the top 5 highest-spending AWS accounts for a given month. In many organizations, accounts are mapped to specific teams, environments (e.g., production, staging), or business units, making this a critical tool for chargeback and accountability.

### **The Approach**

This query is similar to the product spend analysis but changes the grouping dimension. It filters the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) for a specific month, groups all costs by the `line_item_usage_account_id`, and uses a `LIMIT 5` clause to return a "leaderboard" of the highest-spending accounts. This provides an immediate, actionable list for targeted FinOps conversations.

### **The SQL Query**

```sql
-- Select the usage account ID for grouping.
SELECT
    line_item_usage_account_id,
    -- Sum the unblended cost and round for readability.
    round(sum(line_item_unblended_cost), 2) AS cost
FROM
    your-table.cost-and-usage-reports
-- Filter for a specific month and year to analyze.
WHERE
    month = '1'
    AND year = '2025'
-- Group the results to aggregate costs by account.
GROUP BY
    line_item_usage_account_id
-- Order the results to find the highest costs first.
ORDER BY
    cost DESC
-- Limit the output to the top 5 spenders.
LIMIT 5;
